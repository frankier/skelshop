SkelShop is a toolkit usable either as a suite of command line tools or a
Python library aimed at *offline analysis* of the ``talking heads'' genre of
videos, typically created in a television studio. This genre includes news
and current affairs programmes, variety shows and some documentaries. The
main attributes of this type of material is:
 * Multiple fixed place cameras in a studio with shot changes to different
   cameras and non-studio material.
 * Mainly upper bodies are visible.
 * Frontal shots are the most frequent type.
 * Faces are usually visible and most often frontal.
 * Occlusion is as often by an OSD (On Screen Display) than by some other
   object in the scene.

## Getting started

[See the documentation.](https://frankier.github.io/skelshop/)

## Features

 * Dump OpenPose skeletons to a fast-to-read HDF5 file format
 * A processing pipeline starting with shot segmentation
 * Apply black box person tracking on OpenPose skeletons
 * Draw skeletons over video and...
   * View the result in real time
   * Output the result to another video
 * Convert from some existing JSON based dump formats
 * Embed faces using dlib
   * Using OpenPose's face detection and keypoint estimation
   * Or using dlib's own face detection/keypoint estimation
   * Select best frames for best quality embeddings
 * Dump across heterogeneous HPC environments including GPU and CPU nodes.
 * Identify faces based on embeddings
   * Identify by direct comparison with references
   * Or cluster faces with no reference (also useful re-identitication)
   * Identify faces based on clusters, either with a reference or interactively
   * Quickly build up libraries of references using data from WikiData/WikiMedia commons

Thanks to the authors of all the useful libraries I have used.

Some of the black box tracking code is based
on [this repository](https://github.com/lxy5513/cvToolkit).

Some code to do with clustering and usage of FAISS is based on [this repository](https://github.com/yl-1993/learn-to-cluster/).
